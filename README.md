# BasketballVR
This is a hobby project I've been working on, making a simple Basketball shooting game for Oculus Quest. In order to open this project, you need Oculus' forked version of Unreal 4.22. Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEtu-ciPc7g) to see how you set it up.

The project is currently only working for Oculus Quest.
